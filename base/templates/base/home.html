    <h2>Constant Monitoring for Susceptibility</h2>
    <p>
        It is crucial to constantly monitor the risk factors and living conditions that may contribute to the
        susceptibility of cerebral stroke. Factors such as high blood pressure, smoking, and a sedentary lifestyle
        can increase the risk. Regular check-ups and a healthy lifestyle play a vital role in prevention.
